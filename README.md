## ¬ Leverage - a minimal oh-my-zsh theme

### Description
Based off of the standard minimal theme, Leverage uses colors, and an extra `¬` character, to better distinguish the command line prompt from your output. Leverage-C is slightly more compact. It's useful for users who work with long git branch names. 

### Installation

#### Install Leverage
- Put the `leverage.zsh-theme` file in your `~/oh-my-zsh/themes` directory. 
  - `cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/&&curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gschnall/leverage/master/leverage.zsh-theme`
  - Note: the file must be named leverage.zsh-theme
- Next, in your zshrc, change your `ZSH_THEME` to `leverage`.
  - It should look like this: `ZSH_THEME="leverage"`

#### Install Leverage-C

  - `cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/&&curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gschnall/leverage/master/leverage-c.zsh-theme`
  - Note: the file must be named leverage-c.zsh-theme
- Next, in your zshrc, change your `ZSH_THEME` to `leverage-c`.
  - It should look like this: `ZSH_THEME="leverage-c"`
