### Description
Based off of the standard minimal theme, Leverage uses colors, and an extra `¬` character, to better distinguish the command line prompt from your output. 

### Installation
- Put the `leverage.zsh-theme` file in your `~/oh-my-zsh/themes` directory. 
  - Note: the file must be named "leverage.zsh-theme"
- Next, in your zshrc, change your `ZSH_THEME` to `leverage`.
  - It should look like this: `ZSH_THEME="leverage"`
